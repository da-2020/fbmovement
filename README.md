Prototype Data Science Project

This project was derived from this repository: https://github.com/Coding-with-Adam/Dash-by-Plotly and this Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-M2KQ6_bM4.

It takes a parsed section of the Facebook Movement dataset (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/c3429f0e-651b-4788-bb2f-4adbf222c90e), applies it to a bar chart and juxtaposes attack data from https://acleddata.com/ and then deploys it to a Heroku instance. I am still learning so please ask me questions but know that I may have to google the answer.
