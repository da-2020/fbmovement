Prototype Data Science Project

This project was dirived from this repository: https://github.com/Coding-with-Adam/Dash-by-Plotly and this Youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-M2KQ6_bM4.

It takes a parsed section of the Facebook Movement dataset and applies it to a bar chart, and then deploys it to a Heroku instance. I am still learning so please ask me questions but know that I may have to google the answer.
